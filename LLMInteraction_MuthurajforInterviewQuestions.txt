[Claude explored the project folder, read JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb,
README.md, and StudyGuide.txt.txt to understand the context.]

[2026-02-27 10:33:30] CLAUDE:
I've reviewed everything. Here's what I understand:

**Deliverable 1** — I conduct a 15-question quiz (A-E multiple choice, one
at a time) covering the 8 study guide topics + scenario/behavioral questions.

**Deliverable 2** — Based on your quiz results (especially weak areas), I
generate `JobInterviewGuide_Workshop_Muthuraj.ipynb` with explanations,
code exercises, and a reflection prompt.

**Deliverable 3** — `.gitignore`, updated `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`.

Before I start, a few clarifying questions:

1. Do you have the workshop notebooks (StudyMaterials.zip) available, or
   should I conduct the quiz based solely on the StudyGuide.txt topics listed?

2. Should I also update the original JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb with
   your quiz results (name, date, score, topics missed, etc.) after the quiz?

3. For the generated notebook name, should it be exactly
   JobInterviewGuide_Workshop_Muthuraj.ipynb or do you want a different name?

4. Any preference on difficulty level for the quiz?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:00] CLAUDE:
I've reviewed all your workshop materials in detail. Here's a quick summary
before we begin:

--- 500-Word Content Summary ---

Your coursework covers the full ML fundamentals pipeline across 5 workshops.
Workshop 1 (Data Streaming) introduced real-time sensor data from industrial
robots, anomaly detection using Statistical Process Control (mean +/- 2.5
sigma), and the Coefficient of Variation as a health metric. Workshop 2
(Linear Regression) built univariate linear regression both from scratch
(gradient descent) and with sklearn, using robot motor degradation data. Key
concepts: slope as degradation rate, intercept as baseline, temporal
train/test splits to prevent data leakage, and metrics (RMSE, MAE, R², MSE).
MLOps principles like YAML configs and modular code were introduced.
Workshop 3 (Performance Metrics) used MNIST for binary classification ("is
it a 5?"), teaching the full metrics progression: accuracy limitations with
imbalanced data, confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1 score,
precision-recall tradeoff via decision thresholds, ROC curves, and AUC. The
DummyClassifier demonstrated why accuracy alone is misleading. Workshop 4
(KNN) applied K-Nearest Neighbors to the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset with
risk-label engineering. Key patterns: sklearn Pipeline preventing leakage,
StandardScaler fit only on training data, GridSearchCV with StratifiedKFold,
f1_weighted scoring, and distance metrics (Euclidean vs Manhattan). Workshop
5 (Logistic Regression) covered the sigmoid function, why linear regression
fails for classification, log-loss/cross-entropy, decision thresholds, and
precision-recall tradeoffs in real-world contexts (medical screening, spam
filters, self-driving cars).

--- 100-Word Interview Topic Summary ---

The study guide emphasizes: (1) Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
distinctions, (2) dependent vs. independent variable identification, (3)
train/validation/test splits with data leakage awareness, (4) linear
regression including residuals and linearization, (5) regression analysis
comparing parametric vs. non-parametric models with R² and MSE, (6) logistic
regression covering intercept, slope, and cross-entropy loss, (7) KNN
algorithm with hyperparameter tuning (k, distance metric, weights), and (8)
decision trees focusing on leaf nodes and predictions. All topics require
algorithmic explanation ability.

All right Muthuraj, let's begin the interview! I'll ask one question at a
time. Take your time and select the best answer.

==============================================================================
QUIZ BEGIN — 15 QUESTIONS
==============================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 1 of 15 — Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:10] CLAUDE:
In your Robot Predictive Maintenance workshop, you trained a linear
regression model where `elapsed_hours` predicted `mean_current`. This is an
example of supervised learning. Which of the following best explains *why*
it is supervised?

(A) Because the model uses gradient descent to optimize weights
(B) Because the training data includes both input features (elapsed_hours)
    and known output labels (mean_current), so the model learns from correct
    answers
(C) Because the algorithm groups similar robots together based on their
    sensor patterns
(D) Because the model was validated using a temporal train/test split
(E) Because the model makes predictions on new, unseen data after training

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:25] USER (Muthuraj):
b

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:26] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** Supervised learning means the model learns from labeled data —
both inputs (X) and known outputs (y) are provided during training. The
model essentially has an "answer key" to learn from.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 2 of 15 — Dependent vs. Independent Variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:30] CLAUDE:
In the Logistic Regression workshop, you predicted whether a student would
pass or fail based on hours studied. Which statement correctly identifies
the variables?

(A) Hours studied is the dependent variable; pass/fail is the independent
    variable
(B) Both hours studied and pass/fail are independent variables
(C) Hours studied is the independent variable (feature); pass/fail is the
    dependent variable (target)
(D) The dependent variable is the one the researcher controls in an
    experiment
(E) In classification problems, there are no dependent or independent
    variables — only features and clusters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:45] USER (Muthuraj):
c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:46] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** The independent variable (feature/predictor) is what we feed
into the model — hours studied. The dependent variable (target/label) is
what we're trying to predict — pass/fail. It "depends on" the input.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 3 of 15 — Train/Validation/Test Split
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:38:50] CLAUDE:
In your Linear Regression workshop, the robot sensor data was split using a
temporal (chronological) split instead of a random split. Why was this the
correct approach?

(A) Because temporal splits always produce higher R² scores than random splits
(B) Because random splits are only appropriate for classification tasks, not
    regression
(C) Because randomly shuffling time-series data would let the model "peek"
    at future data points during training, causing data leakage and overly
    optimistic performance estimates
(D) Because sklearn's train_test_split function does not work on DataFrames
    with datetime columns
(E) Because temporal splits ensure equal class distribution across train and
    test sets

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:39:15] USER (Muthuraj):
c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:39:16] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** With time-series data, a random split would mix future and past
observations in the training set. The model could then learn patterns from
"the future" that wouldn't be available in real deployment — that's data
leakage. The temporal split ensures the model only trains on earlier data
and is tested on later data, just like real-world conditions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 4 of 15 — Linear Regression: Residuals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:39:20] CLAUDE:
In your Linear Regression workshop, you plotted residuals vs. predicted
values to evaluate model quality. You see the following pattern: residuals
are randomly scattered around zero with no visible pattern. What does this
tell you?

(A) The model is overfitting the training data
(B) The model has high bias and needs more features
(C) The linear assumption is reasonable — the model captures the relationship
    well and errors are random, not systematic
(D) The model's R² must be exactly 1.0
(E) The residuals should follow an exponential distribution for the model to
    be valid

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:39:40] USER (Muthuraj):
a

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:39:41] CLAUDE:
**Incorrect.** The correct answer is **(C)**.

When residuals are randomly scattered around zero with no visible pattern
(no curves, no funnels), that's actually a good sign. It means:
- The linear relationship assumption holds
- The errors are random, not systematic
- The model isn't missing a hidden pattern

If the model were overfitting (A), you'd see residuals very close to zero
on training data but large/scattered on test data. A random scatter around
zero is exactly what we *want* to see — it means the model is capturing the
real signal and only the unpredictable noise remains.

If you saw a curved pattern in the residuals, that would suggest a
non-linear relationship and you'd need linearization (e.g., polynomial
features or log transforms).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 5 of 15 — Regression Metrics: R² vs. MSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:39:50] CLAUDE:
Your Robot Predictive Maintenance workshop reported these results for the
scratch model: R² = 0.0046, MSE = 70.99. Which interpretation is correct?

(A) The model explains 46% of the variance in mean_current — a decent fit
(B) The MSE of 70.99 means the model's predictions are off by exactly 70.99
    Amps on average
(C) The model explains only about 0.46% of the variance in mean_current, and
    the MSE of 70.99 (in squared units) indicates large prediction errors —
    the model is a poor fit
(D) R² and MSE measure the same thing, just on different scales
(E) An R² close to zero means the model is overfitting

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:40:10] USER (Muthuraj):
d

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:40:11] CLAUDE:
**Incorrect.** The correct answer is **(C)**.

R² and MSE are related but measure different things:
- R² = 0.0046 means the model explains only 0.46% of the variance — nearly
  zero. (Not 46%! — watch the decimal.) An R² of 1.0 = perfect, 0.0 = no
  better than just predicting the mean.
- MSE = 70.99 is in squared units of the target variable (Amps²). It tells
  you the average squared error. To get the error in the original units,
  you'd take the square root: RMSE = ~8.43 Amps.

Key distinctions from your Logistic Regression workshop notes:
| Feature        | MSE                               | R²                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Main purpose   | Average prediction error magnitude | Proportion of variance explained  |
| Scale          | Squared units of target variable  | Unitless (ratio 0–1)              |
| Interpretation | Absolute measure of error         | Relative; context-free            |

An R² near zero means the model is essentially no better than predicting
the average — that's a poor fit, not overfitting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 6 of 15 — Logistic Regression: The Sigmoid Function
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:40:20] CLAUDE:
In your Logistic Regression workshop, you learned that the sigmoid function
σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) is the core of logistic regression. What happens
when the input z = 0?

(A) σ(0) = 0, meaning the model predicts class 0
(B) σ(0) = 1, meaning the model predicts class 1
(C) σ(0) = 0.5, which is exactly the default decision boundary — the model
    is maximally uncertain
(D) σ(0) is undefined because you cannot divide by zero
(E) σ(0) = e ≈ 2.718

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:40:40] USER (Muthuraj):
b

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:40:41] CLAUDE:
**Incorrect.** The correct answer is **(C)**.

Let's work through the math:
σ(0) = 1 / (1 + e^(-0)) = 1 / (1 + e^0) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2 = 0.5

When σ = 0.5, the model is sitting right on the decision boundary — it's
maximally uncertain, essentially saying "I have no idea which class this
belongs to." This is why the default decision threshold is 0.5:
- σ(z) >= 0.5 (z >= 0) → predict class 1
- σ(z) < 0.5 (z < 0) → predict class 0

Remember the S-curve from your workshop:
- As z → large positive numbers: σ → 1 (confident class 1)
- As z → large negative numbers: σ → 0 (confident class 0)
- At z = 0: σ = 0.5 (the tipping point)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 7 of 15 — Logistic Regression: Cross-Entropy Loss
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:40:50] CLAUDE:
In your Logistic Regression workshop, you learned about log-loss
(cross-entropy). Suppose a sample's true label is y = 1 and your model
predicts a probability of p = 0.99. A second sample also has y = 1 but your
model predicts p = 0.51. Both predictions are technically *correct* (both
above 0.5). How does log-loss treat them?

(A) Both receive the same log-loss because both predictions are correct
(B) The p=0.51 prediction receives a much higher (worse) log-loss because
    the model was barely confident — log-loss rewards calibrated confidence,
    not just correctness
(C) The p=0.99 prediction receives a higher log-loss because extreme
    probabilities are penalized
(D) Log-loss is only computed on incorrect predictions, so neither receives
    any penalty
(E) Log-loss treats them identically because it only looks at the binary
    prediction (1 or 0), not the probability

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:41:15] USER (Muthuraj):
b

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:41:16] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** This is exactly the Employee A vs. Employee B analogy from your
workshop.

For y = 1:
- loss = -log(p)
- p = 0.99 → loss = -log(0.99) ≈ 0.01 (tiny penalty — very confident and
  correct)
- p = 0.51 → loss = -log(0.51) ≈ 0.67 (much larger penalty — barely
  confident)

This is the key advantage of log-loss over accuracy. Accuracy treats both as
equally correct (both predicted class 1). But log-loss rewards well-calibrated
confidence — a model that "knows what it knows" scores better than one that
just barely gets it right.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 8 of 15 — KNN: Hyperparameters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:41:25] CLAUDE:
In your KNN workshop, you used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters on the
Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The parameter grid was: k = [3, 5, 7, 9],
metric = ['euclidean', 'manhattan'], weights = ['uniform', 'distance'] with
5-fold StratifiedKFold. How many total model fits did GridSearchCV perform?

(A) 16 — one for each combination of hyperparameters
(B) 40 — each of the 16 combinations is trained on 5 different folds, but
    only validated once
(C) 80 — each of the 16 combinations is trained and validated 5 times (once
    per fold), totaling 4 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80
(D) 5 — one fit per fold, using the best hyperparameters
(E) 160 — each combination is fit on both train and validation for each fold

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:41:50] USER (Muthuraj):
c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:41:51] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** The math is:

- 4 values of k × 2 metrics × 2 weight options = 16 combinations
- Each combination is trained and evaluated 5 times (once per CV fold)
- 16 × 5 = 80 total fits

That's the power (and cost) of GridSearchCV — it's exhaustive. Every single
combination gets a fair evaluation across all folds. StratifiedKFold was
used specifically because the "Low" risk class had very few samples (~35),
so preserving class proportions in every fold was critical.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 9 of 15 — KNN: Distance Metrics (Scenario-Based)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:42:00] CLAUDE:
You're building a KNN model to predict diabetes risk using medical features
like glucose, BMI, and blood pressure. Some patients have extreme outlier
values in insulin levels. Your colleague suggests using Euclidean distance.
What would you recommend instead, and why?

(A) Use Cosine distance because medical data is always angular
(B) Use Manhattan (L1) distance because it treats all deviations linearly
    rather than squaring them, making it less sensitive to large outliers in
    individual features
(C) Use Chebyshev distance because it only considers the maximum difference
    across features
(D) Stick with Euclidean — distance metrics don't matter as long as you
    scale the features
(E) Remove all outliers from the dataset instead of changing the distance
    metric

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:42:25] USER (Muthuraj):
e

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:42:26] CLAUDE:
**Incorrect.** The correct answer is **(B)**.

While removing outliers (E) might seem reasonable, it's not always
appropriate — especially in medical data where extreme values can be
clinically meaningful (a very high insulin reading is real and informative,
not just noise).

The key insight from your KNN workshop:

- Euclidean (L2) distance squares the differences before summing. So an
  outlier with a huge deviation in one feature dominates the entire distance
  calculation.
- Manhattan (L1) distance sums the absolute differences — it treats all
  deviations linearly. A large outlier in one feature still contributes
  proportionally, but doesn't overwhelm the other features.

Your workshop notes specifically stated: "Manhattan treats all deviations
linearly — often better for medical data with outliers."

Think of it like this: if two patients differ by 200 units in insulin but
only 2 units in glucose:
- Euclidean: 200² + 2² = 40,004 → insulin completely dominates
- Manhattan: 200 + 2 = 202 → insulin is large but glucose still contributes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 10 of 15 — Decision Trees: Leaf Nodes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:42:35] CLAUDE:
In a decision tree classifier, what happens at a leaf node when making a
prediction?

(A) The tree splits the data again using the feature with the highest
    information gain
(B) The tree applies a sigmoid function to compute a probability
(C) The leaf node assigns the majority class among the training samples that
    reached that node — no further splitting occurs
(D) The leaf node computes the mean squared error of all samples and returns
    it as the prediction
(E) Leaf nodes are only used during training and are discarded during
    prediction

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:42:55] USER (Muthuraj):
c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:42:56] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** A leaf node is the end of the road for a decision path. When a
new data point travels down the tree and lands at a leaf:

- For classification: it gets assigned the majority class of the training
  samples that ended up in that leaf
- For regression: it would get the mean value of the training samples in
  that leaf (but that's option D's context, not classification)

No more splitting happens — that's what makes it a "leaf." The deeper the
tree (more splits), the purer the leaves, but also the higher the risk of
overfitting. That's why max_depth is an important hyperparameter, as you
explored in your exercises.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 11 of 15 — Decision Trees: Overfitting (Scenario-Based)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:43:05] CLAUDE:
You train a Decision Tree with no max_depth limit on a training set and get
100% training accuracy but only 62% test accuracy. What is happening and
what would you try first?

(A) The model is underfitting — increase the number of features
(B) The model is overfitting — the tree has memorized the training data by
    creating extremely specific rules. Limit max_depth or set
    min_samples_leaf to force the tree to generalize
(C) This is expected behavior for decision trees — they always get 100% on
    training data and there's nothing you can do
(D) The test set is too small — collect more test data and the accuracy will
    rise to 100%
(E) Switch to KNN because decision trees cannot handle this type of data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:43:30] USER (Muthuraj):
b

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:43:31] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** This is a textbook case of overfitting. The huge gap between
training accuracy (100%) and test accuracy (62%) is the giveaway.

An unrestricted decision tree will keep splitting until every leaf contains
samples from only one class — it essentially memorizes the training data,
including the noise. Think of it like a student who memorizes every answer
on practice exams word-for-word but can't handle new questions.

The fix: constrain the tree's complexity with hyperparameters like:
- max_depth — limit how deep the tree can grow (you used max_depth=3 in
  your exercise)
- min_samples_leaf — require a minimum number of samples in each leaf
- min_samples_split — require a minimum number of samples to allow a split

This forces the tree to learn general patterns rather than memorizing
specific data points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 12 of 15 — Data Leakage (Scenario-Based)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:43:40] CLAUDE:
In your KNN workshop, you used an sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline with
StandardScaler and KNeighborsClassifier inside GridSearchCV. Why was the
Pipeline critical here?

(A) Pipelines run faster than fitting the scaler and model separately
(B) Pipelines automatically select the best features before fitting the model
(C) Without the Pipeline, the scaler would be fit on the entire dataset
    (including validation folds), leaking information about the validation
    data into training — the Pipeline ensures the scaler is re-fit only on
    each training fold
(D) Pipelines are required by sklearn's API — GridSearchCV won't work
    without one
(E) The Pipeline converts categorical variables to numeric, which KNN
    requires

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:44:00] USER (Muthuraj):
c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:44:01] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** This is one of the most important practical concepts in your
coursework.

Without a Pipeline inside GridSearchCV, you'd have to scale the data before
passing it to the grid search. That means the scaler sees the entire dataset
— including the validation folds — which is data leakage.

With a Pipeline:
1. GridSearchCV creates fold 1 (train) and fold 1 (val)
2. The scaler fits only on fold 1 train data
3. The scaler transforms both train and val using those train-only statistics
4. The model trains and is evaluated
5. Repeat for all folds — scaler is re-fit fresh each time

Your workshop exercise also demonstrated this anti-pattern explicitly:
  # BAD: scaler fit on full data before split
  scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)  # leaks val/test info
vs.
  # GOOD: scaler inside Pipeline
  pipe = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('knn', KNeighborsClassifier())])

----------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 13 of 15 — Imbalanced Data (Behavioral/Scenario)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:44:10] CLAUDE:
You're interviewing for an ML role and the interviewer asks: "You're
building a fraud detection model. Only 0.5% of transactions are fraudulent.
Your model achieves 99.5% accuracy. Is this good?" What's the best response?

(A) Yes, 99.5% accuracy is excellent — deploy the model immediately
(B) No — a DummyClassifier that predicts "not fraud" for every transaction
    would also achieve 99.5% accuracy. Accuracy is misleading with
    imbalanced classes. I'd evaluate using precision, recall, F1, and the
    precision-recall curve, and choose metrics based on the business cost
    of false negatives (missed fraud) vs. false positives (flagged
    legitimate transactions)
(C) No — the model needs at least 99.9% accuracy to be useful for fraud
    detection
(D) Yes, but only if the model was trained using logistic regression
    specifically
(E) You can't build ML models when one class is less than 1% of the data

[2026-02-27 10:44:36] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** Excellent answer — this is exactly the kind of reasoning
interviewers look for.

This was a core lesson from your Performance Metrics workshop with MNIST.
The DummyClassifier that always predicted "not a 5" achieved ~91% accuracy
simply because only ~9% of digits were 5s. Same principle here — with 0.5%
fraud, always predicting "not fraud" gives you 99.5% for free.

The mature response demonstrates:
- You understand why accuracy is misleading with class imbalance
- You know alternative metrics (precision, recall, F1, PR curve)
- You think about business context — missing fraud (FN) costs money;
  flagging legitimate customers (FP) costs trust
- From your Logistic Regression workshop: medical screening prioritizes
  high recall (catch every case); similarly, fraud detection likely favors
  recall too

QUESTION 14 of 15 — Model Choice Tradeoffs (Behavioral/Scenario)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:44:45] CLAUDE:
An interviewer asks: "You have a small medical dataset (800 samples, 8
features). You need an interpretable model that a doctor can understand.
You're choosing between KNN, Logistic Regression, and a Decision Tree.
Which do you pick and why?"

(A) KNN — because it's non-parametric and works well on small datasets
(B) Logistic Regression — because it always outperforms other models on
    medical data
(C) Decision Tree (with limited depth) — because it produces human-readable
    if/then rules that a doctor can follow and verify. Logistic Regression
    is also a strong choice for its interpretable coefficients, but the
    tree's visual flowchart is most intuitive for non-technical stakeholders
(D) None of these — you need a deep neural network for medical data
(E) It doesn't matter which model you choose as long as you tune the
    hyperparameters well enough

a

[2026-02-27 10:45:11] CLAUDE:
**Incorrect.** The correct answer is **(C)**.

The key word in the question was "interpretable" — a doctor needs to
understand *why* the model makes a decision.

Let's compare all three on interpretability:

| Model               | Interpretability | Why?                                    |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Decision Tree       | Highest          | Visual if/then rules a doctor can read  |
| Logistic Regression | High             | Coefficients show feature importance    |
| KNN                 | Low              | No explicit rules or formula            |

KNN is indeed non-parametric and can work on small datasets, but it's the
least interpretable of the three. It has no coefficients, no rules, no
formula — just "nearest neighbors voted." When a doctor asks "why did you
flag this patient?", KNN can only say "because similar patients were
flagged."

In healthcare, interpretability isn't a nice-to-have — it's often a
regulatory requirement.

QUESTION 15 of 15 — Putting It All Together (Scenario-Based)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-02-27 10:45:20] CLAUDE:
You've built a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults. Your
model's log-loss on the validation set is 0.42, but on the test set it
jumps to 0.71. The precision on the validation set was 0.85 but drops to
0.63 on the test set. What is the most likely explanation, and what should
you investigate?

(A) The test set is broken — regenerate it with a different random_state
(B) Log-loss and precision measure different things, so you can't compare
    them across sets
(C) The model is likely overfitting to the validation set, OR there is data
    leakage in the preprocessing pipeline (e.g., scaler fit on validation
    data). Investigate whether preprocessing was done correctly (Pipeline
    vs. manual), check if the validation and test distributions differ, and
    consider using cross-validation instead of a single split
(D) This is normal — test set performance is always much worse than
    validation performance
(E) Increase the decision threshold to 0.9 to fix the precision drop on
    the test set

[2026-02-27 10:45:46] CLAUDE:
**Correct!** Outstanding reasoning on the final question.

The significant drop across both metrics (log-loss: 0.42→0.71,
precision: 0.85→0.63) between validation and test is a red flag. The
investigation checklist you'd follow:

1. Check for data leakage — Was the scaler/encoder fit on data that
   included validation samples? (Use a Pipeline!)
2. Check distribution shift — Are the validation and test sets drawn from
   similar populations? Plot feature distributions side by side.
3. Check for overfitting to validation — If you tuned hyperparameters
   extensively on a single validation split, the model may have overfit to
   that specific split. Cross-validation helps.
4. Check sample sizes — A small validation set can give overly optimistic
   estimates by chance.

TOPICS MISSED (5):
1. Linear Regression — Residual interpretation
2. Regression Metrics — R² vs. MSE distinction
3. Logistic Regression — Sigmoid function computation
4. KNN — Distance metric selection (Euclidean vs. Manhattan)
5. Model interpretability tradeoffs

STRENGTHS:
- Strong on data leakage and pipeline concepts
- Solid understanding of cross-entropy / log-loss
- Excellent scenario-based reasoning (imbalanced data, overfitting, debugging)
- Good grasp of decision trees and GridSearchCV mechanics

BEHAVIORAL NOTES:
- Demonstrated good reasoning about real-world tradeoffs (fraud detection,
  overfitting diagnosis)
- Needs practice connecting mathematical formulas to their intuitive meaning
  (sigmoid, R² decimal interpretation)
- Should review when to remove outliers vs. choosing robust methods

NEXT STEPS FROM LLM:
1. Practice computing sigmoid values by hand for different z values
2. Review residual plot interpretation — what different patterns mean
3. Study R² vs. MSE distinctions: what each measures, units, interpretation
4. Compare distance metrics (L1 vs. L2) with numerical examples
5. Build a comparison framework for model interpretability in different contexts
