    "**Q1. [Supervised Learning]**  \n",
    "A company wants to build a model to predict next month's sales revenue from historical data. Which type of learning best describes this task?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Reinforcement learning  \n",
    "B) Unsupervised clustering  \n",
    "C) Supervised regression  \n",
    "D) Dimensionality reduction  \n",
    "E) Semi-supervised classification  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: Predicting a continuous numeric output (sales revenue) from labeled historical data is a supervised regression task. The target variable is known and continuous.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. [Unsupervised Learning]**  \n",
    "Which algorithm is an example of unsupervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Decision Tree  \n",
    "B) K-Nearest Neighbors  \n",
    "C) Linear Regression  \n",
    "D) K-Means Clustering  \n",
    "E) Logistic Regression  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: D ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: K-Means discovers natural groupings in data without any labeled output. All other options are supervised — they require a labeled target variable during training.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. [Independent vs. Dependent Variables]**  \n",
    "You are building a model to predict blood pressure using a patient's age, weight, and salt intake. Which of the following is an independent variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Blood pressure  \n",
    "B) Patient outcome  \n",
    "C) Salt intake  \n",
    "D) Hospital admission rate  \n",
    "E) Model accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: Independent variables (features/inputs) are what we feed into the model. Blood pressure is the dependent variable (target). Salt intake, age, and weight are independent variables.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. [Train/Val/Test Split]**  \n",
    "You have 10,000 samples and want a 70/15/15 train/val/test split. What is the correct approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Split once into 70% train and 30% test; use train for validation  \n",
    "B) Split into 70% train and 30% temp; then split temp 50/50 into val and test  \n",
    "C) Use all data for training and evaluate with cross-validation only  \n",
    "D) Randomly shuffle and take every 3rd sample for each set  \n",
    "E) Use the first 70% of rows for train and last 30% for testing  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: B ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: The two-step split is the correct method: first split off 30% as a temporary holdout, then split that 50/50 to yield 15% val and 15% test. This ensures no data contamination.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. [Data Leakage — Target Leakage]**  \n",
    "You include a feature `days_since_last_payment` in a loan default prediction model. After deployment the model performs much worse than in testing. What likely happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The model had too many features  \n",
    "B) The test set was too small  \n",
    "C) The feature is a result of the default event — it is only available after the label is known  \n",
    "D) The model overfitted to noise  \n",
    "E) K was set too high in KNN  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: D ❌ INCORRECT** *(Correct answer: C)*  \n",
    "*Explanation: This is target leakage — the feature `days_since_last_payment` is causally downstream of the default event itself. During training the model learned a shortcut that does not exist at prediction time, producing inflated test performance and collapsed deployment performance.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. [Linear Regression — MSE & R²]**  \n",
    "Two linear regression models are trained on the same dataset. Model A has R² = 0.88, MSE = 12.4. Model B has R² = 0.76, MSE = 24.1. Which model should you prefer and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Model B — lower R² means less overfitting  \n",
    "B) Model A — higher R² and lower MSE indicate better fit and smaller prediction errors  \n",
    "C) Model B — higher MSE means the model is more conservative  \n",
    "D) They are equivalent — R² and MSE always agree  \n",
    "E) Model A — but only if the dataset has fewer than 1,000 samples  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: B ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: R² closer to 1 means more variance explained; lower MSE means smaller squared errors. Model A is strictly better on both metrics — prefer it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. [Residuals]**  \n",
    "After fitting a linear regression, you plot residuals vs. fitted values and notice the spread of residuals increases as fitted values increase (funnel shape). This indicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The model is underfitting  \n",
    "B) There are too many features  \n",
    "C) Heteroscedasticity — the variance of errors is not constant  \n",
    "D) The target variable is normally distributed  \n",
    "E) The model is perfectly calibrated  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: A funnel-shaped residual plot is the signature of heteroscedasticity — the OLS assumption of constant error variance (homoscedasticity) is violated. Fix: log-transform the target or use weighted least squares.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. [Logistic Regression — Intercept]**  \n",
    "In a logistic regression model, the intercept β₀ represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The slope of the decision boundary  \n",
    "B) The model's accuracy when all features equal zero  \n",
    "C) The log-odds of the positive class when all independent variables equal zero  \n",
    "D) The total variance explained by the model  \n",
    "E) The cross-entropy loss at convergence  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: B ❌ INCORRECT** *(Correct answer: C)*  \n",
    "*Explanation: β₀ is the log-odds (not probability or accuracy) of the positive class when every feature is zero. To convert to probability: P = sigmoid(β₀) = 1/(1+exp(-β₀)). Accuracy is a post-hoc classification metric, not part of the model equation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. [Logistic Regression — Cross-Entropy]**  \n",
    "Cross-entropy loss for binary classification is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values  \n",
    "B) Mean absolute error between probabilities and labels  \n",
    "C) −[y·log(p) + (1−y)·log(1−p)] averaged over all samples  \n",
    "D) R² subtracted from 1  \n",
    "E) The number of misclassified samples divided by total samples  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: Binary cross-entropy (log loss) formula is −[y·log(p) + (1−y)·log(1−p)]. When y=1, only −log(p) matters. When y=0, only −log(1−p) matters. This heavily penalizes confident wrong predictions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10. [KNN — Effect of k]**  \n",
    "You train a KNN classifier with k=1 and observe 100% training accuracy but 61% test accuracy. What is the most likely cause?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The features are not normalized  \n",
    "B) The dataset is too large for KNN  \n",
    "C) k=1 causes the model to overfit — it memorizes each training point  \n",
    "D) The distance metric is incorrect  \n",
    "E) The class labels are imbalanced  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: With k=1, every training point is its own nearest neighbor, guaranteeing 100% training accuracy. The decision boundary is jagged and overfits noise, causing poor generalization.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q11. [KNN — Feature Scaling]**  \n",
    "Why must features be standardized or normalized before applying KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) KNN cannot handle categorical variables without scaling  \n",
    "B) Scaling reduces the number of neighbors to compute  \n",
    "C) Features with larger numeric ranges will dominate distance calculations, biasing the model  \n",
    "D) Scaling converts the problem from regression to classification  \n",
    "E) KNN requires all features to be binary  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: A feature ranging 0–10,000 (e.g., income) will overwhelm one ranging 0–1 (e.g., age normalized) in Euclidean distance, making the latter nearly irrelevant. Scaling equalizes feature contributions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q12. [Decision Trees — Splitting Criteria]**  \n",
    "A decision tree uses Gini impurity to decide splits. A node has Gini = 0.0. What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The node splits the data into equal halves  \n",
    "B) The node is the root of the tree  \n",
    "C) The node contains samples from all classes equally  \n",
    "D) The node is perfectly pure — all samples belong to the same class  \n",
    "E) The tree has reached maximum depth  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: D ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: Gini impurity = 0 means all samples at that node share the same class label — perfect purity. The algorithm stops splitting at pure nodes (they become leaf nodes).*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q13. [Decision Trees — Prediction]**  \n",
    "During inference, how does a decision tree classify a new sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) It averages predictions from all nodes  \n",
    "B) It applies a sigmoid to the root node output  \n",
    "C) It routes the sample through splits from root to a leaf, then outputs the leaf's majority class  \n",
    "D) It computes Euclidean distance to the nearest training sample  \n",
    "E) It calculates cross-entropy across all branches  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: C ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: Prediction traverses the tree top-down: at each internal node, the sample takes the branch that satisfies the split condition. When it reaches a leaf node, the leaf outputs its stored majority class label.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q14. [Scenario — Choosing Between Models]**  \n",
    "A hospital needs to predict patient readmission risk. The model must have both high recall (catch most at-risk patients) and explainability for medical staff. Which approach is best?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Deep neural network — highest accuracy  \n",
    "B) KNN — straightforward prediction logic  \n",
    "C) Random Forest with SHAP values for explainability  \n",
    "D) Logistic Regression — interpretable coefficients and probability outputs  \n",
    "E) K-Means clustering — groups high-risk patients automatically  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: A ❌ INCORRECT** *(Correct answer: D)*  \n",
    "*Explanation: Logistic regression provides probability estimates (enabling a low threshold for high recall), directly interpretable coefficients that clinicians can reason about, and regulatory compliance in medical settings. Deep neural networks are opaque and not suitable when explainability is required. SHAP + Random Forest is a reasonable runner-up, but logistic regression is the safest and most practical first choice here.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q15. [Scenario — Handling Overfitting]**  \n",
    "Your decision tree achieves 99% training accuracy but only 65% on the validation set. Which TWO actions would most effectively address this? (Choose the best single answer among combined options.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Increase the number of features and remove the validation set  \n",
    "B) Set `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf` to constrain tree complexity  \n",
    "C) Use a larger learning rate and add more trees  \n",
    "D) Replace the decision tree with linear regression  \n",
    "E) Reduce the training set size to 50%  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer given: B ✅ CORRECT**  \n",
    "*Explanation: `max_depth` limits how deep the tree grows (prevents memorization). `min_samples_leaf` requires a minimum number of samples at each leaf (avoids splits on noise). Together they are the two most direct regularization tools for decision trees.*\n",

    "**1. Which 1–2 concepts were most challenging, and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging concept was **target leakage** — specifically, recognizing when a feature is causally *caused by* the label rather than being a cause *of* it. In Q5, I diagnosed the deployment failure as overfitting because the symptoms looked identical: good training performance, poor real-world performance. I missed the root cause, which was that `days_since_last_payment` only exists after a default occurs, making it impossible to observe at prediction time. The second challenging concept was the **logistic regression intercept β₀**: I incorrectly mapped it to accuracy rather than recognizing it as the log-odds baseline when all features equal zero, which is a subtly different quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What trade-offs or assumptions did you overlook in the interview?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q14, I prioritized raw accuracy over explainability when selecting a model for a clinical setting. I overlooked the hard constraint that medical stakeholders legally and ethically require interpretable predictions — a neural network would likely not pass hospital compliance review regardless of its accuracy. I also failed to consider that logistic regression's probability outputs allow clinicians to tune the classification threshold for high recall (catching most at-risk patients), making it the better fit for the stated requirements. The lesson is to identify hard constraints (regulation, explainability, latency) before optimizing for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is your plan to improve over the next week?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This week I will work through five real-world case studies of target leakage (credit risk, healthcare, e-commerce churn) and for each feature I will ask: *would this be available in production before the prediction is needed?* For logistic regression, I will write out the full math — from linear combination to log-odds to sigmoid to probability — by hand at least three times until β₀ and β₁ feel intuitive. For model selection, I will build a simple decision matrix with axes for accuracy, explainability, inference speed, and regulatory context, and practice applying it to at least two scenario questions per day until the framework is automatic.\n"
